**The ClockINO Project**

**How to use it?**


**1. Menu button:** After pressing this button, the clock will wait for time input. You have to press 4 numbers on the remote, indicating the hour. For example, “08:25” would be MENU, 0,8,2,5.

**2. Audio:** Works the same as Menu, except that it sets the time for the alarm, not for the clock. If you set an hour that already passed, the alarm will trigger the next day. If you set the alarm for an hour to come, it will trigger the same day, at the specified time.

**3. Exit:** Will stop the alarm from going off, or it will stop it if it already begun. Use this button when you don’t want your alarm anymore.

**4. Standby:** Or, as I call it the Power button. It enables/disables the hours and minutes digits to be shown permanently. Use it only when the digits are not shown by the PIR sensor, as not to interfere with it.

**5. Mute:** Exactly what standby does, except that it’s for the seconds.

**6. Info:** This button enables **Vol+** and **Vol-** to increase/decrease the seconds by one at a time. Use it for fine tuning the time.

**7. Fav:** This button enables **Ch+** and **Ch-** to increase/decrease the hours, by one at a time. Use it when time switches between Winter / Summer.

**8. Recall button:** Test the alarm’s buzzer without setting an alarm. If you want to stop it, press recall again when the buzzer is not emmiting sound. If you do it otherwise, it’ll just keep making an annoying noise.
